Analysis of the relationship between seasons and music listening habits 

### Data 
- Billboard Hot 100 : https://data.world/kcmillersean/billboard-hot-100-1958-2017
- Million Song : http://millionsongdataset.com/

### Questions 
(1) Does the quantity of unique songs we listen to differ by season (i.e. do we need more variety in our music depending on the season)?     
(2) Do the seasons effect what genre of music we listen to?  

### Hypotheses 
1. I expect there to be a greater quantity of unique songs consumed in the Spring and Summer. This is due to not only to festival lineup in these months, but also the recommendation by MusicConsultant.com to avoid releasing music in the winter.   
2. I expect that there will be a seasonal effect on genre. Particularly, I believe I will see a preference for pop in the Summer and Spring months, and a preference in rock, soul, and angst (emo, punk, grunge) in the Fall and Winter. I believe this, based not only because of the seasonal study by Pettijohn, but also because of the previous research about using music as a coping mechanism.

### Methods 
- Poisson Regression
- Random Forest
